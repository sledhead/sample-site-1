									<p style="text-align: center;">BURNHAM CHRISTMAS LETTER – 2024</p>
									<p style="text-align: center;">Oh give thanks to the Lord!  For He is good!</p>
									<p style="text-align: center;">His Mercy endures Forever!</p>
									<p style="text-align: center;">Greetings!  We hope you have had a good and blessed year 
										with a lot of laughter, days of sun shine and good health.</p>

									<p>Our main event for the year was building on and completing the 30 by 48 ft. greenhouse!</p>
									<p>It took us a lot, lot longer than we anticipated. Mainly, it made sense just for us to get at it.  
										It took six years to be exact and without the help of our good neighbor, Mark Hemingway it would have taken longer.   
										We finally pulled the skin or plastic over the top on Oct. 2, while praying the wind would die down.  
										We tied down the sides and rejoiced, thanking the Lord it was secure.  It has roll up sides along both sides for ventilation during the summer. 
										On Oct. 16, the four of us each took a corner and pushed the completed green house over (Wes’ 16 peach trees).  
										The trees are now enclosed for the winter months.   The greenhouse has electric lights and an oil burner stove in it. </p>

									<p>In August, Jay and Candy went to Great Falls, Mt. to hear Heidi Baker.  
										Candy had been with Heidi Baker Ministry in Pembre, Africa in 2015. 
										From Great Falls they came here for a week.  We did a lot of talking, and playing with Olivia. 
										We went to the Fair parade in Kalispell and up the South Fork picking huckleberries.  
										Martin encountered a mother moose and her two little ones.  He backed away and left them alone.</p>
									<p>Jay, Candy, and Olivia came back again in November to celebrate Thanksgiving with us.  
										Martin went at 6:45 AM, Wed. Nov. 27 to pick them up at the train station in Whitefish.  
										Jay left Monday, Dec. 1st, for a speaking engagement in L. A. and Candy and Olivia stayed a week longer.  
										They left by plane on Dec.7th at 4:18 PM heading back to Seattle in the evening fog.
										Olivia really enjoyed her Uncle Martin and Aunt Crystal reading to her.</p>
